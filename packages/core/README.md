# @mcp-ui/core

This package will contain core utilities, constants, and helper functions shared across the mcp-ui ecosystem.
It aims to provide foundational pieces that don't belong to a more specific package like schemas, generators, or components.

(Currently under development - may consolidate types from other packages here later.)
